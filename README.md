The utilization of std::map<std::string, City> in the CitySearch class offers distinct advantages. It provides a key-value association, 
allowing efficient retrieval of cities by name. The ordered structure of std::map ensures  std::map's binary search tree implementation
enables fast search operations with a time complexity of O(log n), facilitating quick lookup of cities. 
Furthermore, std::map enforces unique keys, preventing duplicate city names from being added.
Overall, the choice of std::map<std::string, City> offers efficient search capabilities, 
ordered iteration, and key uniqueness, making it well-suited for managing city data in the CitySearch class.
